# TigerShark-Rerun
The recode of our 2025 bot

This recode allows us to take advantage of command-based programming.
The Old code will be visible, but is extremely broken and should be used as an example of what not to do.

Some code will be transfered over from the old bot code.

Due to the state of TigerShark's old code, We felt like the quickest way forward with recoding is to start fresh.
