# TigerShark-Rerun
The total recode of our 2025 bot

This recode allows us to take advantage of command-based programming.
The Old code will be visible, but is extremely broken and should be used as an example of what not to do.

The only things taken from the old code is for climbing and pathplanner, but they will be modified.

Made with:
RevLib
Phoenix6
PathPlanner
GrappleHook
WpiLib 2025

Made by:
Smithville TigerTrons, Team 5503

Made in Java.
